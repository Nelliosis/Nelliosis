### :telescope: Things I'm working on at the moment
* [Henrietta-bot](https://github.com/Nelliosis/Henrietta-bot) \
Henrietta is my personal discord companion and bot. I aspire her to play music, do polls and manage scheduling events on my behalf. Her name is based from my original character of the same name.

### :seedling: Things I'm studying on
* [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) \
Harvard University's introduction to Computer Science. Even as I am a sophomore Computer Science Student, I feel the need to continously develop my foundations. 
* [JavaScript](https://javascript.info/) \
I'm studying JavaScript because of it's multi-use cases. I feel like this is a powerful language to add to my current repertoire of languages.

### :books: Things I'm interested at the moment
* [The Blockchain](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/36KBMBOG) \
The Blockchain is an interesting emerging technology that's caught my eye, as people around me have been consistently, one by one, drop into the crypto space, the most popular implementation of the Blockchain. 
* [Discord Bot Making with Discord.js](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin) \
Making discord bots with JavaScript is, I feel, the best way to learn how to use the language properly. I hope to cascade this knowledge into Web Development as well.
* [Server Creation and Management](https://www.youtube.com/c/NetworkChuck/videos)\
NetworkChuck's videos on server management and creation has me interested ever since my first dip into Cloud Computing. The reality of making and maintaining your own network has been somewhat of a dream of mine. It's very interesting.

### :open_book: Things I plan to take up soon
* [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) \
I want to properly grasp web development in earnest, as I believe this is a skill critical to a 21st century person. Especially with how many aspects of human life is moving to the internet. Now more than ever, I believe is the time to learn and grasp the fundamental concepts of the web.
