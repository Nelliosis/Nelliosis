### :wave: Greetings

I'm Jun. Primarily DevOps, occasionally backend, sometimes blockchain. My hobbies include lots of YouTube, tons of gaming, and lots of learning. I have a couple of systems under my belt, but I constantly strive to learn more.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Things I am maintaining or continually improving

* [Henrietta-bot](https://github.com/Nelliosis/Henrietta-bot) \
I have a bot as a proof of concept to myself that I can start, develop and complete a project in its entirety. I maintain this for personal use with my friends.

### :telescope: Things I'm working on at the moment

* Docker Swarm
I like how simple it is to deploy with Swarm. But I've started to hit the ceiling of what I can do with it.
* DevOps & AWS
I have created and enforced Agile practices with our team with an emphasis on velocity. So I tweaked some parts of the process in order to achieve that. I made pipelines that deploy to our staging and prod environments. I also made those environments.
* Solidity
I've been developing with Solidity for quite a while now. I've developed smart contracts here and there, and managed to communicate with and automate deployments through our backend servers.

### :seedling: Things I'm studying on

* Kubernetes
I am now aspiring to learn more and start using Kubernetes in earnest. I know the basics but I still have a lot to learn.
* AWS Certifications
I've been pretty busy building new stuff, but at some point I'd also like to complete one of the AWS Certifications

### :open_book: Things I plan to take up soon

* Azure & GCP Certifications
Nice to haves. I'd like to eventually take these.

### :medal_sports: My certificates
